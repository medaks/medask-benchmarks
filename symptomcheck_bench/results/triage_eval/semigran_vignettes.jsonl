His immunisation history is significant for not having received a complete tetanus immunisation schedule. He presents with signs of generalised tetanus with trismus (“lock jaw”), which results in a grimace described as “risus sardonicus” (sardonic smile). Intermittent tonic contraction of his skeletal muscles causes intensely painful spasms, which last for minutes, during which he retains consciousness. The spasms are triggered by external (noise, light, drafts, physical contact) or internal stimuli, and as a result he is at the risk of sustaining fractures or developing rhabdomyolysis. The tetanic spasms also produce opisthotonos, board-like abdominal wall rigidity, dysphagia, and apnoeic periods due to contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscles. During a generalised spasm the patient arches his back, extends his legs, flexes his arms in abduction, and clenches his fists. Apnoea results during some of the spasms. Autonomic overactivity initially manifests as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. Several days later this may present as hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension, or hypotension."}
